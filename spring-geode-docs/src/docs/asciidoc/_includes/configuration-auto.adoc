== Auto-configuration

The following Spring Framework, Spring Data for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire (SDG) and Spring Session for Apache Geode
& Pivotal GemFire (SSDG) _Annotations_ are implicitly declared by Spring Boot for Apache Geode & Pivotal GemFire's
(SBDG) _Auto-configuration_.

* `@ClientCacheApplication`
* `@EnableGemfireCaching` (or alternatively, Spring Framework's `@EnableCaching`)
* `@EnableContinuousQueries`
* `@EnableGemfireFunctionExecutions`
* `@EnableGemfireFunctions`
* `@EnableGemfireRepositories`
* `@EnableLogging`
* `@EnablePdx`
* `@EnableSecurity`
* `@EnableSsl`
* `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`

NOTE: This means you DO NOT need to explicitly declare any of these _Annotations_ on your `@SpringBootApplication` class
since they are provided by SBDG already.  The only reason you would explicitly declare any of these _Annotations_ is if
you wanted to "_override_" Spring Boot's, and in particular, SBDG's _Auto-configuration_.  Otherwise, it is unnecessary!

TIP: You should read the chapter in Spring Boot's Reference Guide on
{spring-boot-docs-html}/#using-boot-auto-configuration[Auto-configuration].

TIP: You should review the chapter in Spring Data for Apache Geode and Pivotal GemFire's (SDG) Reference Guide on
{spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstrap-annotation-config[Annotation-based Configuration].  For a quick reference,
or an overview of Annotation-based Configuration, see {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstap-annotations-quickstart[here].

[[geode-configuration-auto-customizing]]
=== Customizing Auto-configuration

You might ask how I can customize the _Auto-configuration_ provided by SBDG if I do not explicitly declare
the annotation?

For example, you mat want to customize the member's "_name_".  You know that the
{spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ClientCacheApplication.html[`@ClientCacheApplication`] annotation
provides the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableGemFireProperties.html#name--[`name`] attribute
so you can set the client member's "_name_".  But SBDG has already implicitly declared the `@ClientCacheApplication`
annotation via _Auto-configuration_ on your behalf.  What do you do?

Well, SBDG supplies a few very useful _Annotations_ in this case.

For example, to set the (client or peer) member's name, you can use the `@UseMemberName` annotation, like so:

.Setting the member's name using `@UseMemberName`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@UseMemberName("MyMemberName")
class SpringBootClientCacheApplication { ... }
----

Alternatively, you could set the `spring.application.name` or the `spring.data.gemfire.name` property in Spring Boot
`application.properties`

.Setting the member's name using the `spring.application.name` property
[source,txt]
----
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.application.name = MyMemberName
----

Or:

.Setting the member's name using the `spring.data.gemfire.cache.name` property
[source,txt]
----
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.data.gemfire.cache.name = MyMemberName
----

In general, there are 3 ways to customize configuration, even in the context of SBDG's _Auto-configuration_:

1. Using {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/config/annotation/package-summary.html[Annotations]
provided by SBDG for common and popular concerns (e.g. naming client or peer members with `@UseMemberName`, or enabling
durable clients with `@EnableDurableClient`).

2. Using well-known and documented {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstrap-annotation-config-properties[Properties]
(e.g. `spring.application.name`, or `spring.data.gemfire.name`, or `spring.data.gemfire.cache.name`).

3. Using {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstrap-annotation-config-configurers[Configurers]
(e.g. {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ClientCacheConfigurer.html[`ClientCacheConfigurer`]).

TIP: For the complete list of _documented_ Properties, see <<geode-configuration-metadata,here>>.

[[geode-configuration-auto-disabling]]
=== Disabling Auto-configuration

Disabling Spring Boot _Auto-configuration_ is {spring-boot-docs-html}/#using-boot-disabling-specific-auto-configuration[explained]
in detail in Spring Boot's Reference Guide.

Disabling SBDG _Auto-confiugration_ was also <<geode-auto-configuration-disable,explained>> in detail.

In a nutshell, if you want to disable any _Auto-configuration_ provided by either Spring Boot or SBDG,
then you can declare your intent in the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, like so:

.Disabling Specific Auto-configuration Classes
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication(
  exclude = { DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class, PdxAutoConfiguration.class }
)
class SpringBootClientCacheApplication { ... }
----

WARNING: Make sure you understand what you are doing when you are "disabling" _Auto-configuration_.

[[geode-configuration-auto-overriding]]
=== Overriding Auto-configuration

Overriding SBDG _Auto-configuration_ was <<geode-autoconfiguration-annotations-overriding,explained>> in detail as well.

In a nutshell, if you want to override the default _Auto-configuration_ provided by SBDG then you must annotate
your `@SpringBootApplication` class with your intent.

For example, say you want to configure and bootstrap an Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire `CacheServer` application
(a peer; not a client), then you would:

.Overriding the default `ClientCache` _Auto-Configuration_ by configuring & bootstrapping a `CacheServer` application
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@CacheServerApplication
class SpringBootCacheServerApplication { ... }
----

Even when you explicitly declare the `@ClientCacheApplication` annotation on your `@SpringBootApplication` class,
like so:

.Overriding by explicitly declaring `@ClientCacheApplication`
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@ClientCacheApplication
class SpringBootClientCacheApplication { ... }
----

You are overriding SBDG's _Auto-configuration_ of the `ClientCache` instance.  As a result, you now have also implicitly
consented to being responsible for other aspects of the configuration (e.g. _Security_)!  Why?

This is because in certain cases, like _Security_, certain aspects of _Security_ configuration (e.g. SSL) must be
configured before the cache instance is created.  And, Spring Boot always applies user configuration before
_Auto-configuration_ partially to determine what needs to be auto-configured in the first place.

WARNING: Especially make sure you understand what you are doing when you are "overriding" _Auto-configuration_.

[[geode-configuration-auto-replacing]]
=== Replacing Auto-configuration

We will simply refer you to the Spring Boot Reference Guide on replacing _Auto-configuration_.
See {spring-boot-docs-html}/#using-boot-replacing-auto-configuration[here].

[[geode-configuration-auto-explained]]
=== Auto-configuration Explained

This section covers the SBDG provided _Auto-configuration_ classes corresponding to the SDG _Annotations_ in more detail.

To review the complete list of SBDG _Auto-confiugration_ classes, <<geode-auto-configuration-disable-classes,see here>>.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-clientcacheapplication]]
==== `@ClientCacheApplication`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/ClientCacheAutoConfiguration.html[`ClientCacheAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/ClientCacheApplication.html[`@ClientCacheApplication`] annotation.

SBDG <<getting-started,starts>> with the opinion that application developers will primarily be building Apache Geode
or Pivotal GemFire <<geode-clientcache-applications,client applications>> using Spring Boot.

Technically, this means building Spring Boot applications with either an Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire `ClientCache`
instance connected to a dedicated cluster of Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire servers that manage the data as part of a
{apache-geode-docs}/topologies_and_comm/cs_configuration/chapter_overview.html[client/server] topology.

By way of example, this means you *do not* need to explicitly declare and annotate your `@SpringBootApplication` class
with SDG's `@ClientCacheApplication` annotation, like so:

.Do Not Do This
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@ClientCacheApplication
class SpringBootClientCacheApplication { ... }
----

This is because SBDG's provided _Auto-configuration_ class is already meta-annotated with SDG's
`@ClientCacheApplication` annotation.  Therefore, you simply need:

.Do This
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
class SpringBootClientCacheApplication { ... }
----

TIP: Refer to SDG's Referene Guide for more details on Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire
{spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstrap-annotation-config-geode-applications[cache applications],
and {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#bootstrap-annotation-config-client-server-applications[client/server applications]
in particular.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablecaching]]
==== `@EnableGemfireCaching`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/CachingProviderAutoConfiguration.html[`CachingProviderAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/cache/config/EnableGemfireCaching.html[`@EnableGemfireCaching`] annotation.

If you simply used the core Spring Framework to configure either Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire as a _caching provider_
in {spring-framework-docs}/integration.html#cache[Spring's Cache Abstraction], you would need to do this:

.Configuring caching using the Spring Framework
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableCaching
class CachingUsingApacheGeodeConfiguration {

  @Bean
  GemfireCacheManager cacheManager(GemFireCache cache) {

      GemfireCacheManager cacheManager = new GemfireCacheManager();

      cacheManager.setCache(cache);

      return cacheManager;
  }
}
----

If you were using Spring Data for Apache Geode's `@EnableGemfireCaching` annotation, then the above configuration
could be simplified to:

.Configuring caching using Spring Data Geode
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableGemfireCaching
class CachingUsingApacheGeodeConfiguration {

}
----

And, if you use SBDG, then you only need to do this:

.Configuring caching using Spring Data Geode
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
class CachingUsingApacheGeodeConfiguration {

}
----

This allows you to focus on the areas in your application that would benefit from caching without having to enable
the plumbing.  Simply demarcate the service methods in your application that are good candidates for caching:

.Using caching in your application
[source,java]
----
@Service
class CustomerService {

  @Caching("CustomersByName")
  Customer findBy(String name) {
    ...
  }
}
----

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-caching-provider,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enableautocontinuousqueies]]
==== `@EnableContinuousQueries`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/ContinuousQueryAutoConfiguration.html[`ContinuousQueryAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableContinuousQueries.html[`@EnableContinuousQueries`] annotation.

Without having to enable anything, you simply annotate your application (POJO) component method(s) with the SDG
{spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/listener/annotation/ContinuousQuery.html[`@ContinuousQuery`]
annotation to register a CQ and start receiving events.  The method acts as a `CqEvent` handler, or in Apache Geode and
Pivotal GemFire's case, the method would be an implementation of
{apache-geode-javadoc}/org/apache/geode/cache/query/CqListener.html[`CqListener`].

.Declare application CQs
[source,java]
----
@Component
class MyCustomerApplicationContinuousQueries

  @ContinuousQuery("SELECT customer.* FROM /Customers customers"
    + " WHERE customer.getSentiment().name().equalsIgnoreCase('UNHAPPY')")
  public void handleUnhappyCustomers(CqEvent event) {
    ...
  }
}
----

As shown above, you define the events you are interested in receiving by using a OQL query with a finely tuned query
predicate describing the events of interests and implement the handler method to process the events (e.g. apply a credit
to the customer's account and follow up in email).

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-continuous-query,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablefunctions]]
==== `@EnableGemfireFunctionExecutions` & `@EnableGemfireFunctions`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/FunctionExecutionAutoConfiguration.html[`FunctionExecutionAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to both the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/function/config/EnableGemfireFunctionExecutions.html[`@EnableGemfireFunctionExecutions`]
and {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/function/config/EnableGemfireFunctions.html[`@EnableGemfireFunctions`] annotations.

Whether you need to {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#function-execution[_execute_] a `Function`
or {spring-data-geode-docs-html}/#function-implementation[_implement_] a `Function`, SBDG will detect the Function
definition and auto-configure it appropriately for use in your Spring Boot application.  You only need to define
the Function execution or implementation in a package below the main `@SpringBootApplication` class.

.Declare a Function Execution
[source,java]
----
package example.app.functions;

@OnRegion("Accounts")
interface MyCustomerApplicationFunctions {

    void applyCredit(Customer customer);

}
----

Then you can inject the Function execution into any application component and use it:

.Use the Function
[source,java]
----
package example.app.service;

@Service
interface CustomerService {

    @Autowired
    private MyCustomerapplicationFunctions customerFunctions;

    public void analyzeCustomerSentiment(Customer customer) {

        ...

        this.customerFunctions.applyCredit(customer);

        ...
    }
}
----

The same pattern basically applies to Function implementations, except in the implementation case, SBDG "registers"
the Function implementation  for use (i.e. to be called by a Function execution).

The point is, you are simply focusing on defining the logic required by your application, and not worrying about
how Functions are registered, called, etc.  SBDG is handling this concern for you!

NOTE: Function implementations are typically defined and registered on the server-side.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-functions,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablerepositories]]
==== `@EnableGemfireRepositories`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/GemFireRepositoriesAutoConfigurationRegistrar.html[`GemFireRepositoriesAutoConfigurationRegistrar`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/repository/config/EnableGemfireRepositories.html[`@EnableGemfireRepositories`] annotation.

Like Functions, you are only concerned with the data access operations (e.g. basic CRUD and simple Queries) required by
your application to carry out its functions, not how to create and perform them (e.g. `Region.get(key)`
& `Region.put(key, obj)`) or execute (e.g. `Query.execute(arguments)`).

Simply define your Spring Data Repository:

.Define an application-specific Repository
[source,java]
----
package example.app.repo;

interface CustomerRepository extends CrudRepository<Customer, Long> {

  List<Customer> findBySentimentEqualTo(Sentiment sentiment);

}
----

And use it:

.Using the application-specific Repository
[source,java]
----
package example.app.sevice;

@Service
class CustomerService {

  @Autowired
  private CustomerRepository repository;

  public void processCustomersWithSentiment(Sentiment sentiment) {

    this.repository.findBySentimentEqualTo(sentiment).forEach(customer -> { ... });

    ...
  }
}
----


Your application-specific _Repository_ simply needs to be declared in a package below the main `@SpringBootApplication`
class.  Again, you are only focusing on the data access operations and queries required to carry out the functions
of your application, nothing more.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-repositories,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablelogging]]
==== `@EnableLogging`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/LoggingAutoConfiguration.html[`LoggingAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableLogging.html[`@EnableLogging`] annotation.

Logging is an essential application concern to understand what is happening in the system along with when and where
the event occurred.  As such, SBDG auto-configures logging for Apache Geode and Pivotal GemFire by default, using
the default log-level, "_config_".

If you wish to change an aspect of logging, such as the log-level, you would typically do this in Spring Boot
`application.properties`:

.Change the log-level for Apache Geode
[source,txt]
----
# Spring Boot application.properites.

spring.data.gemfire.cache.log-level=debug
----

Other aspects may be configured as well, such as the log file size and disk space limits for the file system location
used to store the Apache Geode log files at runtime.

Under-the-hood, Apache Geode's logging is based on Log4j.  Therefore, you can configure Apache Geode logging using
any logging provider (e.g. Logback) and configuration metadata appropriate for that logging provider so long as you
supply the necessary adapter between Log4j and whatever logging system you are using.  For instance, if you include
`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-logging` then you will be using Logback and you will need the
`org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-to-slf4j` adapter.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablepdx]]
==== `@EnablePdx`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/PdxSerializationAutoConfiguration.html[`PdxSerializationAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnablePdx.html[`@EnablePdx`] annotation.

Anytime you need to send an object over the network, overflow or persist an object to disk, then your application domain
object must be _serializable_.  It would be painful to have to implement `java.io.Serializable` in everyone of your
application domain objects (e.g. `Customer`) that would potentially need to be serialized.

Furthermore, using _Java Serialization_ may not be ideal (e.g. the most portable or efficient) in all cases,
or even possible in other cases (e.g. when you are using a 3rd party library for which you have no control over).

In these situations, you need to be able to send your object anywhere without unduly requiring the class type
to be serializable as well as to exist on the classpath for every place it is sent.  Indeed, the final destination
may not even be a Java application! This is where Apache Geode {apache-geode-docs}/developing/data_serialization/gemfire_pdx_serialization.html[PDX Serialization]
steps into help.

However, you don't have to figure out how to configure PDX to identify the application class types that will need to be
serialized.  You simply define your class type:

.Customer class
[source,java]
----
@Region("Customers")
class Customer {

  @Id
  private Long id;

  @Indexed
  private String name;

  ...
}
----

And, SBDG's _Auto-configuration_ will handle the rest!

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-data-serialization,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablesecurity]]
==== `@EnableSecurity`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/ClientSecurityAutoConfiguration.html[`ClientSecurityAutoConfiguration`] class
and {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/PeerSecurityAutoConfiguration.html[`PeerSecurityAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableSecurity.html[`@EnableSecurity`] annotation, but applies
Security, and specifically, Authentication/Authorization configuration for both clients and servers.

Configuring your Spring Boot, Apache Geode `ClientCache` application to properly authenticate with a cluster of secure
Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire servers is as simple as setting a _username_ and _password_ in Spring Boot
`application.properties`:

.Supplying Authentication Credentials
[source,txt]
----
# Spring Boot application.properties

spring.data.gemfire.security.username=Batman
spring.data.gemfire.security.password=r0b!n5ucks
----

NOTE: Authentication is even easier to configure in a managed environment like PCF when using PCC;
you don't have to do anything!

Authorization is configured on the server-side and is made simple with SBDG and the help of https://shiro.apache.org/[Apache Shiro].
Of course, this assumes you are using SBDG to configure and bootstrap your Apache Geode cluster in the first place,
which is <<geode-cluster-configuration-bootstrapping,possible>>, and made even easier with SBDG.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-security,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablessl]]
==== `@EnableSsl`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/SslAutoConfiguration.html[`SslAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableSsl.html[`@EnableSsl`] annotation.

Configuring SSL for secure transport (TLS) between your Spring Boot, Apache Geode `ClientCache` application
and the cluster can be a real problematic task, especially to get correct from the start.  So, it is something
that SBDG makes simple to do out-of-the-box.

Simply supply a `trusted.keystore` file containing the certificates in a well-known location (e.g. root of your
application classpath) and SBDG's _Auto-configuration_ will kick in and handle of the rest.

This is useful during development, but we highly recommend using a more secure procedure (e.g. integrating with a
secure credential store like LDAP, CredHub or Vault) when deploying your Spring Boot application to production.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-security-ssl,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-enablespringsession]]
==== `@EnableGemFireHttpSession`

NOTE: The {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/SpringSessionAutoConfiguration.html[`SpringSessionAutoConfiguration`] class
corresponds to the {spring-session-data-gemfire-javadoc}/org/springframework/session/data/gemfire/config/annotation/EnableSsl.html[`@EnableSsl`] annotation.

Configuring Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire to serve as the (HTTP) Session state caching provider using Spring Session
is as simple as including the correct starter, e.g. `spring-geode-starter-session`.

.Using Spring Session
[source,xml]
[subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.geode</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-geode-starter-session</artifactId>
    <version>{revnumber}</version>
</dependency>
----

With Spring Session, and specifically Spring Session for Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire (SSDG), on the classpath of
your Spring Boot, Apache Geode `ClientCache` Web application, you can manage your (HTTP) Session state with either
Apache Geode or Pivotal GemFire.  No further configuration is needed. SBDG _Auto-configuration_ detects Spring Session
on the application classpath and does the right thing.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-session,documentation>> for more details.

[[geode-configuration-declarative-auto-configuration-regiontemplates]]
==== RegionTemplateAutoConfiguration

The SBDG {spring-boot-data-geode-javadoc}/org/springframework/geode/boot/autoconfigure/RegionTemplateAutoConfiguration.html[`RegionTemplateAutoConfiguration`] class
has no corresponding SDG _Annotation_.  However, the _Auto-configuration_ of a `GemfireTemplate` for every single
Apache Geode `Region` defined and declared in your Spring Boot application is supplied by SBDG never-the-less.

For example, if you defined a Region using:

.Region definition using JavaConfig
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
class GeodeConfiguration {


  @Bean("Customers")
  ClientRegionFactoryBean<Long, Customer> customersRegion(GemFireCache cache) {

    ClientRegionFactoryBean<Long, Customer> customersRegion =
      new ClientRegionFactoryBean<>();

    customersRegion.setCache(cache);
    customersRegion.setShortcut(ClientRegionShortcut.PROXY);

    return customersRegion;
  }
}
----

Alternatively, you could define the "_Customers_" Region using:

.Region definition using `@EnableEntityDefinedRegions`
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableEntityDefinedRegion(basePackageClasses = Customer.class)
class GeodeConfiguration {

}
----

Then, SBDG will supply a `GemfireTemplate` instance that you can use to perform low-level, data access operations
(indirectly) on the "_Customers_" Region:

.Use the `GemfireTemplate` to access the "Customers" Region
[source,java]
----
@Repository
class CustomersDao {

  @Autowired
  @Qualifier("customersTemplate")
  private GemfireTemplate customersTemplate;

  Customer findById(Long id) {
    return this.customerTemplate.get(id);
  }
}
----

You do not need to explicitly configure `GemfireTemplates` for each Region you need to have low-level data access to
(e.g. such as when you are not using the Spring Data Repository abstraction).

Be careful to "qualify" the `GemfireTemplate` for the Region you need data access to, especially given that you will
probably have more than 1 Region defined in your Spring Boot application.

TIP: Refer to the <<geode-data-access-region-templates,documentation>> for more details.
